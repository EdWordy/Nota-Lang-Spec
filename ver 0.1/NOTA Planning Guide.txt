>>> Entry 1:

// I just realized I can use this document [examples\Lang-Example-A.txt] as an example for a markup language (or a notational language, as I've taken to calling these types of langs).
// Which sort of functions like a shift key, as described by Petzold in Code as an escaped sequence, which I've only read the first couple chapters of but which is v good.
// It's safe to say I'm digging it. I wonder if such a lang needs to be interpreted or compiled to run proper. I'd also need to write an editor for the language, 
// and I'm realllllllly thinking hard about doing this.

// tho I could probably use something like Python 3 instead or whatever, as it seems to fit my needs. TKinter would be needed iirc ofc.
// I'm working on the outline for now, but I'll have to rewrite it to explain how it works with graphic design and arrows pointing at
// how it works and what is what in terms of notation.

---

>>> Entry 2:

// I'm thinking this whole NOTA thing can be planned fairly easily, with .txt files. 

// The main issues are practical (the halting problem -_-), which really is writing the interpreter and tools.

// also I think I can avoid using indentation with the concept of empty and filled rows instead of columns.

---

>>> Entry 3:

// I don't want to get stuck in development hell on this, but I sort of believe I have a problem to the halting
// problem, I'm just not sure how to operationalize the solution or the algorithim. It requires async programming.

// EDIT:
// I ended up writing out an algorithm for taking tests, and it's fairly effective. It got me thru some amount 
// of school anyway. And If I recall quickly, Roosevelt used a similar means to take tests as well.

---

>>> Entry 4:

// There are a few ways I could implement NOTA. I'm not sure how I'll do this exactly yet but the
// syntax and grammar, vocabulary and underlying logic are coming together.

// Tho ideally I should use C++ as I spent the past while delving fairly deep and it's quite fresh
// in my mind. I'll have to work on a few more algorithms of course in support of this goal but
// I feel rather confident, as my current efforts have been fruitful, and I feel quite obligated,
// if not empowered.
